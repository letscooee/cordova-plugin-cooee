triggers for end users with simple SDK integration that requires no coding at mobile app level.

## Features

1. Plug and Play - Plugin is plug and play for mobile applications. That means it needs to be initialized with the Application Context, and it
   will work automatically in the background.
2. Independent of Application - Plugin is independent of the application. It will collect data points with zero interference from/to the
   applications. Although applications can send additional data points (if required) to the Plugin using API’s.
3. Rendering engagement triggers - Plugin will render the campaign trigger at real-time with the help of server http calls.
